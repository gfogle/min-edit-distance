# min-edit-distance
Calculates Mininimum Edit Distance between 2 words

## LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE
Given 2 words, the levenshtein distance tells the minimum number of edits -
insertions, deletions, substitutions - that have to be made to transform one
word to another.

## USES
Levenshtein distance has several uses but one of the most widely used might be
word suggestion. For instance, if a user were to type "Jaavscript", running the
algorithm against words might determine that the minimum edit distance between
it and Javascript is small enough that a UI could suggest it as a "did you mean"
scenario
